Makovitz, or Earth as it is now called, is a world in which magic is seldom used and known, whatever remaining magics have all but been silenced to a fever pitch by the powers that be and the death of many magical creatures, like dragons. 

Over time, the continents Gondre, Vagos, Ciupela and Elrah and their countries split apart to become what we know as Earth's Topography. This is speculated to be as a result of a great migration of Giants and Fey Creatures capable of shifting the tides and plates of the world to move the world and start anew. *See: [[The Great Gigant-Fey Migration of 678PMR]]*. But that isn't the most important right now. For now lets look at Makovitz as it is currently.



# [[Gondre]] 

Gondre is home to the most robust religious hubs and simultaneously the most convoluted bureaucratic entities. Such entities as the [[The Scions of the Den Queen]], [[The Tuvish Doctrine]], [[The 12 Noted Families of Glom]] and the [[Conclave de los Elementos]] 



# [[Vagos]] 



# [[Ciupela]]


# [[Elrah]]
