Used to be led by [[Imogen Ren]], the Templar was an organization used to assassinate enemies to Mongulf and by proxy the Tuvish Doctrine, on occasion Imogen would seed dissent amongst some of the assassins in order to send information to whichever world leaders or necessary third parties needed it.

This organization has been dissolved following Imogen's leaving and disappearance, as such this now is publicly shown to be led by Milo Yinsal, who previously handled military affairs but has a new department in espionage in Mongulf's large military.
