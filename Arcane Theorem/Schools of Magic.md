Abjuration: Lead. It blocks divination, and is heavy and hard to move in any real amount.  
  
Transmutation: Mercury. Ever shifting, ever changing.  
  
Necromancy: Iron. Iron chains, cities of iron in the underworld, you get the idea.  
  
Divination: Silver. Polished silver forms mirrors, and mirrors, as well as being a focus for the classic divination (Scrying) are associated with insight.  
  
Evocation: Copper. One of the strongest conductors of electricity, and its colouration can be reminiscent of fire.  
  
Enchantment: Gold. Greed addles the mind, and gold is the focus of greed. Enchantment also addles the mind.

Illusion: How bout Electrum? No one SERIOUSLY took electrum back in the day...  
  
Conjuration: Platinum? (Don't you need platinum for one of the material comp or am I off base?)
