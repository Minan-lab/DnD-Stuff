A mage academy in the north-western reaches of [[Tsetgalia]] known for the study of Astronomy and Advanced Transmutation, namely [[Homunculi]], [[Vessels]], and [[Arcane Engineering]]. It was built in 5PMR after the war and was built as a testament for Tsetgalia to always prioritize the preservation of the culture of Makovitz's people. It was destroyed in 372PMR by a rogue experiment, causing the entire nation to become that of a facsimile of the Feywild, this results in it being a beacon of power and hope for most native fey creatures, serving as reminder and a testament to a different group far removed from Makovitz's surface dwellers. Boop.
