Khan-khan Unlembro'an meaning Arcane Homestead in Elvish is a pretty secluded area of [[Gondre]]. It actually used to be larger than it is now, but that is for another day. What stands here now is what many elves consider the last bastion of the Elvish Diaspora(which absolutely isnt true). There are many ruins depicting the first casting of magic, and records of the creation of the 4 divine thrones. Not many people know of the names of these gods, but some have met them and were met with some shift in fate soon after. Before the Tuvish Doctrine began to go into full force, the town was known to hold temples to Pharadates, this is also where her power is most potent.
