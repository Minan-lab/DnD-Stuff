Dimio aka Nameless is the Soul of Vydre  [[The Outlanders]]

So, Dimio isnt his name. But the act of attaching it to him gives it more power than once thought, the act of speaking it does a number of things:

- Stops the [[Ingrain Project]] 
- Stops [[Vydre]] from coming back as himself
- Kills [[Nimsh]] and [[Tuvsh]]
