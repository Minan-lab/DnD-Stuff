Oliver Tymalo, the Acuity of Vydre but more well known as the Arch-Bishop of the Tuvish Doctrine. 

Oliver was born on 1275BMR(Before Magic Renaissance) as [Vydre](Vydre.md ), a dragon born of the world's earlier strife and bloodshed during a war apart of that same time period, literally formed of the corpses and the choking grief and hatred of the battlefield. Supping on the negative energy he grew to despise Makovitz, and ventured to destroy it, governing the new born world and making sure strife is not an emotion felt in his presence.

After 30 decades of the rage festering, he felt it wise to split himself into three entities to enact his plan to gain power in 3 ways.
- ~~Nameless~~ [[Dimio]], The Soul of Vydre and the First Son of Vydre, Physical Power(Strength).
- [[Tuvsh]], the Wrath of Vydre, Second Son of Vydre, Religious Power.
- and Nimsh, the Acuity of Vydre, The Third Son of Vydre, Social Power.
